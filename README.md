# Knoxchain

Knoxchain is a blockchain-based voting system that utilizes digital IDs to ensure secure and verifiable voting. The project is aimed at improving the transparency and security of voting systems, particularly in situations where remote voting is required.

## Features

- Digital IDs for voters to ensure secure and verifiable voting
- Blockchain-based system for transparency and immutability of votes
- Network of nodes for decentralized and distributed processing
- Audit trail for each vote to enable verification and accountability
- Easy to use and integrate into existing voting systems

## Getting Started

To get started with Knoxchain, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).
3. Run the network listener on a specific address using `cargo run --bin network`.
4. Create a digital ID for each voter using `DigitalID::new(user_id: String)`.
5. Verify the digital ID using `DigitalID::verify_digital_id()`.
6. Create an audit trail for each vote using `AuditTrail::new(user_id: String, vote: String)`.
7. Verify the vote using the digital ID using `AuditTrail::verify_vote(digital_id: &DigitalID)`.
8. Send the vote to other nodes in the network for processing.

## Improvements

Knoxchain is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome. Here are some potential areas for improvement:

- User interface for easier interaction with the system
- More advanced verification methods to prevent fraud and ensure accuracy
- Integration with existing voting systems and platforms
- Additional security measures to protect against attacks and breaches
- Optimization for performance and scalability
